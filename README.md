# iCloud Email Alias Creator

This is a Python project that automates the process of creating email aliases in iCloud using Selenium WebDriver. The script interacts with iCloud's web interface to generate and manage aliases for your email.
You are able to create 5 new hidden emails per hour on the cheapest iCloud version. This code automates it, so that you can maximize free stuff they give you.

## Features

- **Create multiple email aliases**: Generate several aliases at once (up to 5 emails per hour).
- **Automate the process**: The script automatically logs in using saved cookies, creates new aliases, and keeps track of them.
- **Handle iCloud interface**: The script interacts with the iCloud interface through the use of Selenium WebDriver, clicking buttons, filling out forms, and performing other actions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- Chrome WebDriver (make sure it's installed and in your PATH)
